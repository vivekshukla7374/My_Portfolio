      <p>
        I'm Vivek, a passionate web development student currently focused on learning React and front-end technologies. I love building real-world projects to strengthen my skills and better understand modern web development.My goal is to become a professional developer, create impactful projects, and one day share my knowledge just like the mentors who helped me. I'm excited to keep learning, growing, and eventually contribute to the developer community myself.Outside of coding, I enjoy continuous learning and
        sharing knowledge to inspire others to achieve their goals.
